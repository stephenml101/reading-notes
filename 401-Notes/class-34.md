- A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Vocabulary

- Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
- Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
- Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
- Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
- Undirected Graph - a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

For example: Node C is connected to Node A, Node E and Node B. There are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices.

- Directed Graph - also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

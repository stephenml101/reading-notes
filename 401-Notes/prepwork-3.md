* I should not stop learning and get comfortable. In the beginning, I will have the most improvement. I must deliberately practice my skillset and do it on my own motivation.

* The power of "yet" states that you have the future insight of acheivement! It takes off the focus of what is happening now. Engaging with errors allows you to grow by learning from it and correcting it.

* Grit is passion and perserverance.

* Belief in the ability to learn is not fixed and can change with your effort.

* Do not compare yourself to others, but focus on your ideas of success. 

* After taking both of the assessments, I can say that my sperception for sure has grown. I did not score below a 19 on any of the categories in the emotional intelligence test. I also scored over a 100 in the Bias Self-Assessment. Overall, I am excited to see progess in the coming weeks.

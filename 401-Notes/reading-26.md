1. What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.

- Intent is used to start a particular component in Android Studios (activities, services, and broadcast receivers). An example would be to give an intent to a button.

- The Activity is essentially the activity that is associated with that component. In the button case, it would be an onClick()

[GraphQL Intro](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/data-modeling/)

1. What makes an API RESTful?

- A RESTful API follows a client-server architecture, is stateless, uses standard HTTP methods to interact with resources represented in different formats, and provides hypermedia links for dynamic resource discovery and navigation.

2. What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?

- Upsides of using GraphQL include efficient data retrieval, flexible API design, versioning and deprecation control, a strongly typed schema for clarity, and the ability to aggregate data from multiple sources. Downsides include increased complexity, potential server-side complexity, caching challenges, limited HTTP caching, and potential complexity with file uploads.

3. Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.

- In a serverless architecture, developers can focus on writing code without the need to manage servers or infrastructure. The cloud provider takes care of scaling and resource allocation, allowing for increased scalability, cost efficiency, and simplified deployment.

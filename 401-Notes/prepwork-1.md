[The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

* The command line, or the terminal, is a text based interface in which you can enter commands and the interface will respond with a prompt. You can use a series of shortcuts to navigate it.

[Basic Navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php)

* pwd (Print Working Directory) is a great way to help you navigate your directory by telling you what your present working directory is. Another command is ls, which gives you a list of what is available. You can also use a shortcut to certain paths by using ~/ and whatever file name you want to navigate to.

[More About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php)

* One thing to note is that everything that you work with in the terminal is a file. Linux itself is not an extension, such as .png. Linux is case sensitive as well, as well as spaces. Quotes also can be used.

* file
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

* ls -a

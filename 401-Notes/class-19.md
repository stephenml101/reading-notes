[Purely functional programming, from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming)

1. Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

- What I gathered from the reading is that it is possible, but very unlikely.

2. Define purely functional programming.

- A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats all computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions.

3. How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs you’ve written so far in this course?

- A lot of the data structures that we have been using are ones that ar mutable This type of programming seems to be in the opposite direction.

1. What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?

- We've used local storage with key value pairs.

2. Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

- Ensuring quality- Through testing, developers can identify and fix issues, bugs, and inconsistencies, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.

- Detecting early issues- catching bugs

- Code maintenance- automated tests for safety nets

- Enhancing collaboration- providing insight to teams about the application's behavior.

3. Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

- A good analogy would be a chef that has a stack of plates. Each plate represents the different assignments that the plate's purpose is for. Whether it be entree, appetizers, what table, etc.

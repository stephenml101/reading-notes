[Java OO Tutorial (only the Object and Class ones)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/)

1. Explain the difference between an object and a class.

- Object is a software bundle of related state and behavior. Software objects are often used to model the real-world objects that you find in everyday life.

- A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.

2. Name two types of state that a Student object might have.

- name, height, age, ethnicity.

3. Name two types of behaviours that a student object might have.

- reads, on-time, writes, studies.

[Java Classes (do NOT do the Nested Classes section)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classes.html)

1. Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.

- A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from the class blueprint. Constructor declarations look like method declarations—except that they use the name of the class and have no return type.

2. Write the declaration statement for a class named 
“Student” (do not fill it with fields and methods).

``` java
public Student (){

}
```

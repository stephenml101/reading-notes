# Notes from my reading 

* **First Article**

![Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

## Things that stood out
* Headings use the "#" symbol. The more symbols there are, the less important the heading is.
* Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of == characters for heading level 1 or -- characters for heading level 2.
* There should be blank lines before and after a heading
* Always remember ** on each side of what you want **bolded**
* Images always start with a ! followed by the title in brackets and the link in ()

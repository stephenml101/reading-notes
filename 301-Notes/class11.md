2. What is a relational database?

- We have a database that works with certain assumptions and works with SQL language. Like a table. Uses schema and relations.

- Table- A data bin.

4. What is a ‘schema’?

- Fields in a table

5. What is a NoSQL database?

- A large database with collections and documents. No schema. No relations. All information in one place.

6. How does it work?

- All information or data is sent to one place and doesn't have specific schema. 

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?

- It is a database with collections (like a table, but not) and documents (rows in table). Large horizontal collection of data with lots of reading. 

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

- SQL, because you can add new data without having to change a field.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

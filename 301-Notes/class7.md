1. Who is Roy Fielding?

- He is the main author of HTTP

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.



3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- It's all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.


4. What does a GET do?

- They GET stuff from web pages.

5. What does a POST do?

- If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

6. What does PUT do?

- If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

7. What does PATCH do?

- To do a partial update.

## Things I want to know more about:

[React Lifestyle](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

- render happens first

![Chart](/img/diagram.png)

2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

- Mounting

3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

- Constructor, render, componentDidMount, componentWillMount, React Updates

4. What does componentDidMount do?

- This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

[React State Vs Props](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYvD9oBCuJI)

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?

- What you want to initialize your component to or what you want your component to render like.

- Props are like a variable to a function.

2. What is the big difference between props and state?

- Props you pass into a component, state is handeled inside that component.

3. When do we re-render our application?

- When you change the state.

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

- Updates in a form.

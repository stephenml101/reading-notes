[CSS Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

- Alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

- Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

## Psychological Safety

[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://web.archive.org/web/20221125192300/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?

- Members spoke in roughly the same proportion

- Good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice

- Communcation and empathy

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.

- I was in a real estate team meeting where I ran the meeting and all were encouraged to speak up and we helped each other get better.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?

- This allows for a great enviroment, where people can feel welcome. This allows for more productivity and retention.

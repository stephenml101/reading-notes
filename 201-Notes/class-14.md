[CSS Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

- Alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

- Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

# Notes

## HTML

* [Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

* A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an a> element and using the href attribute.

* href= Hypertext Reference, or target, that contains the web address.

* Making links accessable to all readers:

Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.
Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.
Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful.

## CSS

* [CSS Layout: Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)- or the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout.

* By default, a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and the element grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of inline elements is just the size of their content. 

* [CSS Layout: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)

* Static positioning is the default that every element gets.

* Advantages of absolute positioning: popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page.

* Absolute & Fixed position differences: absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. 

## Things I want to know more about:

## JavaScript

* [Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

* To actually use a function after it has been defined (or declared), you've got to run — or invoke — it. This is done by including the name of the function in the code somewhere, followed by parentheses.

* Some functions require parameters to be specified when you are invoking them — these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly.

* Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes.

### [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. Greater efficiency- If I am paired up with someone on my coding journey, I could learn from them or vice versa. We would also get tasks done faster.

2. Job interview readiness- This would greatly help me get prepared for next steps with my career! We could help each other prepare for interviews and review what we have learned.

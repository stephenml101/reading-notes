**[Getting Started](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/)** with computer programming.

* [How the web works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works)

1. Communication is very important to me. That's why I use HTTP. To talk with servers and clients. That way, I don't end up talking to lions...

2. The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any link element references to external CSS stylesheets and any script element references to scripts. JavaScript is last and a visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to interact with it.

* [Website Design & Process](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/What_will_your_website_look_like)

3. To choose an image, go to Google Images and search for something suitable.

* When you find the image you want, right-click the image (Ctrl + click on a Mac), choose Save Image As…, and choose a safe place to save your image.

4. What is the difference between a string vs a number is JS? 

"The only difference here is that when writing a string, you need to surround the value with quotes."

5. What is a variable?

* A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.

[Intro to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/)

1. What is an HTML attribute?

3. The article tag element represents a self-contained composition in a document where as the section tag element represents a generic standalone section of a document.

4. What Elements does a “[typical](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure)” website include?

* Header, navigation bar, main content, sidebar, footer.

5. How does [metadata](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML) influence Search Engine Optimization?

* It is information that is stored in the head, using a description meta tag, which is what shows up in the search engine.

6. How is the meta HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

* <meta name="author" content="Chris Mills" closing tag

[Design a Website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Thinking_before_coding)

**Starting**

Ask yourself these questions:

1. What exactly do I want to accomplish? (the most important question)
2. How will a website help me reach my goals?
3. What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

## Things I want to know more about: 
[Semantics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)

1. Why should you use an h1 element over a span element to display a top level heading?

* Span tags will not give it a semantic value.

2. What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

* Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)

* Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page

* Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes

* Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated

* Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

## Things I want to know more about

[JS Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

- An object is a set of data that computers can use to call anything within the object.

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
How do objects differ from arrays?

- Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.

3. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

- instead of using an index number to select an item, you are using the name associated with each member's value.

4. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

![Object](/img/Object.jpeg)

- This refers to the dog's name in this object. This enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create.

[Intro to DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)

1. What is the DOM?

- programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

- JavaScript uses the DOM to access the document and its elements. The DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.

## Things I want to know more about:

1. The purpose for **alt** is its value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection.

2. Having good semantics in HTML ensures having great accessibility for users.

3. Usually a figure> is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document, but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.
A caption can be associated with the figure> element by inserting a figcaption> inside it (as the first or the last child). The first figcaption> element found in the figure is presented as the figure's caption.

4. **GIF**- Good choice for simple images and animations. Prefer PNG for lossless and indexed still images, and consider WebP, AVIF or APNG for animation sequences.
**SVG**- Vector image format; ideal for user interface elements, icons, diagrams, etc., that must be drawn accurately at different sizes.

5. Best formats for screenshots: Lossless WebP or PNG

# CSS

1. Foreground color defines the elements color. For example, this text would change color. Whereas background would change the color of the black behind this text.

2. If I were to add color to a colorless page, I would use the color wisely and research what would be the best colors for user attraction. 

3. When choosing font styles, I should consider what would be web-safe.

4. font-size: changes the size of the text
font-weight: changes how you want the text to be seen, such as **bold** or *italics*.
font-style: changes the actual letters.

5. To add space in an h1: The letter-spacing CSS property sets the horizontal spacing behavior between text characters. This value is added to the natural spacing between characters while rendering the text.

[Chart.js Documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)

1. What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?

- Chart.js provides a set of frequently used chart types, plugins, and customization options. In addition to a reasonable set of built-in chart types, you can use additional community-maintained chart types . On top of that, it’s possible to combine several chart types into a mixed chart (essentially, blending multiple chart types into one on the same canvas).

- Chart.js is highly customizable with custom plugins to create annotations, zoom, or drag-and-drop functionalities to name a few things

2. List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.

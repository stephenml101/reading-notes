# Class 3 Reading Notes

## [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

* [Ordered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) & [Unordered](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul) lists

1. Unordered lists are used when there is no need for numerical values.

2. You can change bullet styles by putting a ul tag within the li tag (nesting)

3. An ordered list is used for anything with numerical values, such as directions or recipes.

4. You can change numbers by using different attributes such as ol type="i" or start=, etc.

## [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)

* [The Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)

1. The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements

* The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.

2. Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.

* Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.

### [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)

[Arrays.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays) [Operators and Expressions.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) [Conditionals.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals) [Loops.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code)

1. Arrays can have various data types: strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays.

2. [I don't know the answer to number two](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/6043952/discussion_topics/16965973)

3. The assignment (=) operator is used to assign a value to a variable

* The addition assignment (+=) operator adds the value of the right operand to a variable and assigns the result to the variable.

* The subtraction assignment (-=) operator subtracts the value of the right operand from a variable and assigns the result to the variable.

* The multiplication assignment (*=) operator multiplies a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.

* The division assignment (/=) operator divides a variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.

4. The result would be false because false is part of the expression. [Click here to see number 4](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/6043952/discussion_topics/16965973)

5. Real world examples for conditional statements: in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime.

6. A loop can be useful if you want someone to answer a question correctly and they can't move on until they do.

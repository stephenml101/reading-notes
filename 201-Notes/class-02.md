[Intro to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/)

1. Why is it important to use [semantic](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) elements in our HTML?

* In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

2. How many levels of [headings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals) are there in HTML?

* There are 6 levels

3. What are some uses for the sup and sub elements?

* You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning.

4. When using the abbr element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

* The title attribute.

[How CSS is Structured](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_is_structured)

1. What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

* Using an href attribute of a link tag for external CSS.

* Using a style tag for internal CSS.

* Using inline within a single HTML element with a style attribute.

2. Why should we avoid using inline styles?

* Styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. 

* Inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.

3. Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

* What is representing the selector? h2

* Which components are the CSS declarations? color, padding

* Which components are considered properties? black, 5px

[Making Decisions in Your Code- Conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals)

1. An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.

2. What is the use of an else if?

* To provice more than two choices or outcomes.

3. List 3 different types of comparison operators.

* === and !== — test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.

* < and > — test if one value is less than or greater than another.

* <= and >= — test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.

4. What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?

* && — AND; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.

* || — OR; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that one or more of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.

# Notes

## Things I want to know more about:

[What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through.

- Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.


2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- Most of my errors are Syntax, missing a bracket in places, etc.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

- It will allow me to become a better coder by combing through code in order to know how it works.

[The JavaScript Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

- It allows you to section off your code to see where a problem might be.

Define what a breakpoint is.

- Places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.

What is the call stack?

- The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.

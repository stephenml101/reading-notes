## **A Growth Mindset**
A Growth Mindset is always having a "can do" attitude. It is knowing that you have the potential to do anything you put your mind to. It is instilling good  habits consistently, while also knowing that you can always improve. You should always try to avoid a fixed mindset.[^1]

[^1]: In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits.

I can remind myself of a growth mindset by remembering ***3 points***:

- Challenges: Always have a good attitude about something that is challenging, and if I don't understand something right away, take a step back and try it again with a fresh mind.

- Obstacles: See each obstacle as a stop sign rather than a brick wall. Obstacles are meant to be solved!

- Effort: In those times where I don't feel like doing what I know must be done, continually remind myself that the effort is the prize!

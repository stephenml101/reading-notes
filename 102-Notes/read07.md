# Notes
In this reading assignment, I am expanding on my knowledge in using JavaScript.


* [MND Flow Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow)

If someone does not fill out a field, script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not (see link above).

## Things I want to know more about

* [Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables)

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {} (reference link above)

* Try it 

[Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp)

* [Expressions & Operations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

An expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

Two types: 
- those that have side effects (such as assigning values) 
-  those that purely evaluate.
See link above.

# Notes

* [Expressions & Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

Two Types of Expressions

1. those that have side effects (such as assigning values)

2. those that purely evaluate.

* The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.

* The expression 3 + 4 is an example of the second type. This expression uses the + operator to add 3 and 4 together and produces a value, 7. See Article above for example.

The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

* for statement
* do...while statement
* while statement
* labeled statement
* break statement

See link above to learn about each!

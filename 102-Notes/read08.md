# Notes

* [Expressions & Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators)

Two Types of Expressions

1. those that have side effects (such as assigning values)

2. those that purely evaluate.

* The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.

* The expression 3 + 4 is an example of the second type. This expression uses the + operator to add 3 and 4 together and produces a value, 7. See Article above for example.

## Assignment Operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = f() is an assignment expression that assigns the value of f() to x.

## Comparison Operators

* Equal (==) Returns true if the operands are equal.
* Not equal (!=)
* Strict equal (===)
* Strict not equal (!==)
* Greater than (>)
* Greater than or equal (>=)
* Less than (<)
* Less than or equal (<=)

[Loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)

* offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly

## For Statement
A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.

A for statement looks as follows:

for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

  ## While Statement

A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

while (condition)
  statement

**The statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:**

* for statement
* do...while statement
* while statement
* labeled statement
* break statement
* continue statement
* for...in statement
* for...of statement

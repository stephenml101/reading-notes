## Things I Need to Know More About

* 3 Major parts of JavaScript

1. The language itself. This is fairly standard among the various environments.
2. The DOM API - how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser. 
3. The server API (or just API) provided by Node.js or one of the other server-side systems.
* See above link to reference major parts.

* [Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)

4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:

1. Using var
2. Using let
3. Using const
4. Using nothing

* Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
* Must be identified with unique names called identifiers.

**Rules for these names**
* Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
* Names must begin with a letter.
* Names can also begin with $ and _
* Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

**Tip**
* It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
